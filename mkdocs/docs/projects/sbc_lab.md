## Core Components

These are the essential components required to build the Raspberry Pi homelab setup. Recommend between 3-4

- **Raspberry Pi 5** - [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5812)
- **POE Hat with Fan** - [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/poe-hat-f.htm) - for use with PoE switch (see Switch)
- **NVMe Storage** - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XHMB5GP/) - for use with NVMe boards (see Mount)

## Network Infrastructure

To ensure stable connectivity and efficient networking, the following components are included:

- **Network Switch** - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08FCQ8BRC/)
- **Ethernet Cables** - [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FTGETWK/)

## Rack and Mounting Solutions

To organize the homelab setup in a compact and efficient manner, the following mounting solutions are used:

- **Rack Cabinet** - [DeskPi](https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-rackmate-t1-rackmount-10-inch-4u-server-cabinet-for-network-servers-audio-and-video-equipment?variant=44577297367196)
- **Rack Mount with PCIe NVMe Board** - [DeskPi](https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-rackmate-10-inch-2u-rack-mount-with-pcie-nvme-board-for-raspberry-pi-5-4b?variant=44571403223196)

## Summary

This build is designed to be modular, compact, and scalable for various homelab use cases.
 Only a single power cable is required to power the unit along with a single networking cable for providing network access.
 The combination of Raspberry Pi 5, NVMe storage, POE networking, and rack-mounted infrastructure provides a robust and efficient setup.
