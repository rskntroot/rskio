## Rskio

This site is meant to catalog my efforts. Over the years, I've "spun my wheels" to learn, get things working, or explore interesting ideas--only for them to be lost to time. You might see this site as a collection of my notes or at times my memoirs, words shaped only by my inspiration in the moment. However, I intend for it to be much more. This site exists for me along with the hope that something I've done might help you.

## About Me

It's been what now? Just over 10 years since I started working in computing professionally. Right after dropping out of a Computer Science program too (oops)! Oh, and about 14 since I learned my first programming language. What?! I’m in my thirties?! Guess I can’t go saying I’m just some random kid on the internet anymore.

My story starts like many others'. My family couldn't get the WiFi working when broadband internet hit the shelves, leaving me to pick up the slack. What was seen as a knack for electronics quickly snowballed into a middle school robotics class, followed by a summer school course in C# programming. In high school, I managed three semesters of plain ol’ C, along with a few summer courses in electrical engineering, photography, and web design. 

University Java courses were a breeze. However, failing to attend Discrete Mathematics II, Physics, and Calculus classes ended in disaster, showcasing just how much I was in need of some serious structure. One would imagine that studying computer science would impart the imperative of having some semblance of structure in one’s life. Yet, naivety sounded the horns of triumph: I dropped out.

"Real life" had started for me; I didn't have $100 to my name, let alone a bed. I pleaded with both friends and family to host me while I figured things out. Within a few months, I managed to secure a job as a C++ programmer for a company that provided custom software solutions aimed at healthcare—wild! This time was short-lived, and out of fear of my own lack of structure, I decided to enlist. As God would have it, I ended up in computer networking despite my best efforts at Navscoleod. Looking back at that time, I marvel at how I operated, chasing dreams of grandeur, only to be consumed by the consequences of my own naivety.

Imagine being a hobbyist and pseudo-classically trained programmer in the military. Your only task: to maintain critical communications networks. What a treat! I was determined to make the most of each opportunity that came my way. Delving into networking, protocol analysis, and network services, I found myself involved in everything related. This led to redesigning network maintenance systems, building data center environments, employing remote communication systems, and eventually becoming the lead for a cybersecurity initiative.

After separating, I held several contracting positions, including a multi-year stint as a Security Operations Center Lead Engineer. While tackling cybersecurity challenges in air-gapped environments, I grew weary of the pace of government work. These days, I’m a full-time network development engineer, designing and deploying network infrastructure for a Tier-1 cloud provider. In my spare time, I either work on personal projects or dream of the financial freedom that would allow me to dedicate my time to them full-time.

## What does Rskio Mean?

Prounciation:

=== "English"
    `R-S-K-I-O`	

=== "IPA"
    `ɑːr-ɛs-keɪ-aɪ-əʊ`

Nothing. Just like QUIC and the G in GNU. As a "programmer" from a young age, I too struggle with naming variables and cache invalidation. It's a blend of a nickname I had when I was younger and Input/Output, or IO. After trying to come up with something clever that pays homage to Nihei's TOHA Heavy Industries, I inevitably gave up and wrestled with Route53 until it provided me with a 5-letter .com that made sense to me.

The same goes for "Rskntroot", it's a mix of that same nickname and the classic "root" term. 

## Projects

Currently, this is an unorganized list of things I have spent many of what corporate America refers to as "cycles" on.

## Storage

Also projects, but those dedicated to storage technology.
