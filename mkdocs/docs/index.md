## Rskio

This site (a project of mine in and of itself) is meant to catalog my efforts. Through the years, I have "spun my wheels" in order to learn, get something working, or even try something interesting--only for it to be lost to time. You could boil this site down to my notes. However, I fully intend for it to be much more than that. This site exists for me and the possibilty that it might help you too.


## About

Its been what, now? Around 10 years since I started working in computing proffessionally (right after dropping out of a Computer Science program, oops). Oh and about 14 since I'd learned my first programming language. What?! I'm in my thirties?! Guess I can't go saying I'm just some random kid on the internet anymore. 

Just like everyone else my age, I got into computing because my family didn't know how to get the wifi working when we finally got broadband internet. Somehow that got me into robotics and programming in middle school and it snowballed from there. After a multi-year stint with the challenges of the cyber security field, I found peace by letting other people deal with it. These days I'm a full-time computer engineer that designs and deploys network infrastructure for a Tier-1 cloud provider.  In my spare time, I work on projects, or dream of a financial freedom and getting able to work on whatever projects I want full-time, or both.

## What does Rskio Mean?

Prounciation:

=== "English"
    `R-S-K-I-O`	

=== "IPA"
    `ɑːr-ɛs-keɪ-aɪ-əʊ`

Nothing. Just like QUIC and the G in GNU. As a "programmer" from a young age, I too struggle with naming variables and cache invalidation. It's sort of a mix of a nickname I had when I was young and Input/Outout or IO. After trying to think of something clever that pays homage to Nihei's TOHA Heavy Industries, I inevtiably gave up and fought with Route53 until it provided me a 5-letter .com that made sense to me. 

The same goes for "Rskntroot", it's a mix of that same nickname and the classic "root" term. 

## Projects

Currently, this is an unorganized list of things I have spent many of what corporate America refers to as "cycles" on.

## Storage

Also projects, but those dedicated to storage technology.
