## Rskio

This site is meant to catalog my efforts.
 Over the years, I've "spun my wheels" to learn, get things working, or explore interesting ideas--only for them to be lost to time.
 You might see this site as a collection of my notes or at times my memoirs, words shaped only by my inspiration in the moment.
 However, I intend for it to be much more.
 This site exists for me along with the hope that something I've done might help you.

## What does Rskio Mean?

Prounciation:

=== "English"
    `R-S-K-I-O`

=== "IPA"
    `ɑːr-ɛs-keɪ-aɪ-əʊ`

Nothing.
 Just like QUIC and the G in GNU.
 As with anyone who has been "coding" since 2008, I struggle with naming variables and cache invalidation.
 After trying to pay homage to Nihei's TOHA Heavy Industries, but inevitably settling on the first reasonable sounding 5-letter .com there was.
 I decided to use a blend of a nickname (ruskonator) I was given and Input/Output (IO) and get to work.
 The same goes for "Rskntroot", it's a mix of that same nickname and the classic "root" term.

## Projects

Currently, this is an unorganized list of things I have spent many of what corporate America refers to as "cycles" on.

## Storage

Also projects, but those dedicated to storage technology.
