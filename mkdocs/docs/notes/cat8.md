# CAT8

Never heard of her, but she is real.

## Really...

Telco Data [article](https://www.telco-data.com/blog/cat-cables/):

"Category 8 is the official successor to Cat6A cabling.
 It is officially recognized by the IEEE and EIA and parts and pieces are standardized across manufacturers.
 The primary benefit of Cat8 cabling is faster throughput over short distances: 40 Gbps up to 78’ and 25 Gbps up to 100’.
 From 100’ to 328’, Cat8 provides the same 10Gbps throughput as Cat6A cabling."

ANSI/TIA [TIA Press Release](https://standards.tiaonline.org/tia-issues-new-balanced-twisted-pair-telecommunications-cabling-and-components-standard-addendum-1):

"TIA-568-C.2-1 - This addendum specifies minimum requirements for shielded category 8 balanced twisted-pair telecommunications
 cabling (e.g. channels and permanent links) and components (e.g. cable,connectors, connecting hardware, and equipment cords)
 that are used up to and including the equipment outlet/connector in data centers, equipment rooms, and other spaces that need
 high speed applications. This addendum also specifies field test procedures and applicable laboratory reference measurement
 procedures for all transmission parameters."
