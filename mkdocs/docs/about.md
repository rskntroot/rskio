## Story

It's been what now? Just over 10 years since I started working in computing professionally.
 Right after dropping out of a Computer Science program too (oops)! Oh, and about 14 since I learned my first programming language.
 Guess I’m not just some random kid on the internet anymore.

My story starts like many others'.
 My family couldn't get the WiFi working when broadband internet hit the shelves, leaving me to pick up the slack.
 What was seen as a knack for electronics quickly snowballed into a middle school robotics class, followed by a summer school course in C# programming.
 In high school, I managed three semesters of plain ol’ C, along with a few summer courses in electrical engineering, photography, and web design.

University Java courses were a breeze.
 However, failing to attend Discrete Math II, Physics, and Calculus classes ended in disaster.
 One would imagine that studying computer science would impart the imperative of having some semblance of structure in one’s life.
 Yet, naivety sounded the horns of triumph: I dropped out.

"Real life" had started for me; I didn't have $100 to my name, let alone a bed.
 I pleaded with both friends and extended family to host me while I figured things out.
 Within a few months, I managed to secure a job as a C++ programmer for a company that provided custom software solutions aimed at healthcare—wild!
 This time was short-lived, and out of desperation I decided to enlist.
 As God would have it, I ended up in computer networking despite my best efforts at Navscoleod.
 Looking back at that time, I marvel at how I operated.
 A boy fixed on dreams of grandeur, yet consumed by the consequences of naivety.

Imagine being a hobbyist and pseudo-classically trained programmer in the military.
 Your only task: to maintain critical communications networks.
 What a treat!
 Delving into networking, protocol analysis, and network services, I found myself involved in everything related.
 This led to redesigning network management systems, building data center environments, employing remote communication systems, and eventually becoming the lead for a cybersecurity initiative.

After separating, I held several contracting positions, including a multi-year stint as a Security Operations Center Lead Engineer.
 While tackling cybersecurity challenges in air-gapped environments, I grew weary of the pace of government work.
 These days, I’m a full-time network development engineer, designing and deploying network infrastructure for a Tier-1 cloud provider.
 In my spare time, I either work on personal projects or daydream of the financial freedom that would allow me to dedicate myself to those projects full-time.
